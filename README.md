# TargetCrafter's Multipixel 32x RTX Resource pack

This is a resource-pack based on @ZouChenyunfei's MultiPixel resource-pack available [here](https://mcpedl.com/multipixel-texture-pack/). The goal is to make all the textures work with ray-tracing in the Windows 10 version of Minecraft. This means that a normal and a MER (Metallic, Emission, Roughness) maps have to be added to each of the available textures.

# Map creation guide
In the future I will add a guide to this page to show how to make the required maps for this resource-pack. This is for accessibility as well as consistency.
For now you can follow these guides by Mojang and Nvidia:

[Minecraft Texture Set Documentation (Mojang)](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360051308931-Minecraft-Texture-Set-Documentation)

[Minecraft with RTX PBR Texturing Guide (Nvidia)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/minecraft-rtx-texturing-guide/)

For each texture, a .xcf file will be created with the editable versions of the maps. This can be opened and edited using [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/). For the normal maps I used the [normalmap plugin](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gimp-normalmap/).
